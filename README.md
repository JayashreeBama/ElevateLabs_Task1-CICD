Hey there
i have learned about Github Actions for CICD by using a sample nodejs app
i clonned nodejs-demo-app from github
created a .github/workflows/main.yml file
this main.yml file describes the workflow of CICD pipeline
i installed the Dependencies for nodejs
i tested using npm test

then i build docker image and deployed it in Dockerhub
